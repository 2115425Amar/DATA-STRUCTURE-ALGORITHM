const user1 = { 
  name: "Amar",
  age: 25
};

const user2 = { 
  name: "Amar",
  age: 25
};
💡 What’s Happening Behind the Scenes:
user1 and user2 are two separate objects.

Even though they have the same values, they are stored at different locations in the heap.

In the stack, user1 and user2 just hold references (pointers) to those heap locations.

🔍 Comparing the Objects:
js
Copy
Edit
console.log(user1 === user2); // ❌ false
Even though the properties are identical, the references are different — they point to different heap objects.

✅ Why?
Because in JavaScript:

=== checks for reference equality when comparing objects.

Two different object literals always result in different memory locations.

🧠 Visual Representation:
yaml
Copy
Edit
Stack:
┌────────────┬────────────┐
│ user1      │ 0xABC123   │───┐
│ user2      │ 0xDEF456   │───┐
└────────────┴────────────┘   │
                              ↓
Heap:
0xABC123 → { name: "Amar", age: 25 }
0xDEF456 → { name: "Amar", age: 25 }
✅ If you want them to point to the same object:
js
Copy
Edit
const user1 = { name: "Amar", age: 25 };
const user2 = user1;

console.log(user1 === user2); // ✅ true (same reference)
Let me know if you want to see how mutation works in this case.

==

Great! Let's clarify the difference between == and === in JavaScript — especially in the context of your object example.

✅ == vs === in JavaScript
Operator	Name	Compares	Type Coercion?	Example Result
==	Loose Equality	Values only	✅ Yes	"5" == 5 → true
===	Strict Equality	Values + Types	❌ No	"5" === 5 → false

💡 With objects, both == and === compare references, not content.
js
Copy
Edit
const user1 = { name: "Amar" };
const user2 = { name: "Amar" };

console.log(user1 == user2);   // ❌ false
console.log(user1 === user2);  // ❌ false
Both == and === return false because user1 and user2 point to different memory locations, even if their contents look the same.

✅ Only true if same reference:
js
Copy
Edit
const user1 = { name: "Amar" };
const user2 = user1;

console.log(user1 == user2);   // ✅ true
console.log(user1 === user2);  // ✅ true
🔁 Quick Summary:
Use === most of the time — it's safer and predictable.

Use == only if you explicitly want to allow type coercion (e.g., user input string compared to number).

Let me know if you want a table comparing different == and === results with various types (numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, objects, etc.)!








You said:
name1: "Amar", name2: "Amar"

You're now asking about this:

js
Copy
Edit
const name1 = "Amar";
const name2 = "Amar";
✅ Are name1 and name2 equal?
js
Copy
Edit
console.log(name1 == name2);   // ✅ true
console.log(name1 === name2);  // ✅ true
💡 Why?
Because "Amar" is a primitive value (string), and primitives are compared by value, not by reference.

🔍 Internally:
JavaScript stores primitive strings like "Amar" in memory efficiently — often reusing the same location for identical string literals (this is called string interning in some languages).

So:

name1 and name2 both hold the same string value.

Both == and === compare them by value → result is true.

🔁 Summary:
Type	Compared by	==	===
String	Value	✅	✅
Object	Reference	❌	❌
